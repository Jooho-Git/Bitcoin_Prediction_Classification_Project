# üìà BigsCoin  
Hello! This is the 14th Tobig's Conference Project, **Bigscoin**.

**Bigscoin** provides users with personalized Bitcoin pattern notifications and interpretable prediction services.

To add explainability and reliability to the prediction of deep learning models which are considered black boxes,

we developed a visualizing system that allows you to see **Bitcoin charts patterns and price predictions** at a glance using XAI techniques.

## Classification
Coin investors often set up investment strategies by referring to the candlestick chart patterns.  

Among the chart patterns, five most observed patterns in coin charts are as follows.

However, **monitoring chart patterns all day long is time consuming and labor intensive**.  
In addition, traditional chart pattern detection services are difficult to recognize at a glance.  
They are not trustworthy because they lack of explanatory power is often missing.  

To address this inconvenience, we used **explainable deep learning models** in our real-time pattern alert service**.  

### Data   
- Crawling the market price, high price, low price, and closing price in 5 minute candlestick chart using "pyupbit" package [August 2017 ~ May 2022]  
- Transforming price data into candlestick chart images (Model input)   
- Image data labeling (5 different chart patterns)  

### Model  
We utilized **Gradcam** to visually interpret the **Conv2d-based model** output.  
You can see the **why the model chose to make that prediction** by looking at the Grad-Cam results.
Users can easily figure out whether the pattern predicted by the model is a significant and trustworthy.

## Regression
Users who receive pattern notifications start to think about their investment strategies,   
especially for **triangle patterns** where ups and downs are unpredictable.  
**N-BEATS** which is an explainable time series model can help users establish their strategies.  

### Data   
- Crawling the market price, high price, low price, and closing price in 5 minute candlestick chart using "pyupbit" package  

### Model  
We use **N-BEATS model**, a deep learning architecture that decomposes its forecast into two distinct components, **trend and seasonality**, to provide explanation in the model.
**Drop-out** is added to the model to visualize confidence interval for population mean of the predictions.
